# Rise & Shine #hackzurich16

**The worlds first distributed alarmclock**

**Rise and Shine** connects your Alarm to the Cloud. Set your Alarm once to ring on all
your devices, turn it off on one device to silence them all. **Rise and shine** lets you
also share your Alarms with your beloved ones. Never get out of bed too late again.

_Disclaimer: The authors of Rise and Shine did not really experience any sleep
during the time of creation_
